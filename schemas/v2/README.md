Jobs specified by the protocol should have the following ensurance.

Resource requirement
--------------------

Each task in a job runs in one isolated container.
The container uses the docker image defined in `taskRoles.<name>.dockerImage`,
and the resources for the container should meet all resource requirements defined in `taskRoles.<name>.resourcePerInstance`.

Runtime environment variables
-----------------------------

For each container in a multi-task job, one task might communicate with others.
So a task need to be aware of other tasks' runtime information such as IP, port, etc.
The system exposes such runtime information as environment variables to each task's container.
For mutual communication, user can write code in the container to access those runtime environment variables.
Those environment variables can also be used in the job config file.

Below we show a complete list of environment variables accessible in a container:
